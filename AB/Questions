Question 1 – Complete Project Initialization and Version Tracking
You have been appointed as a backend developer and are asked to set up a new Node.js project named inventory_system entirely using the terminal without using any GUI tools. You must configure Git globally with your name and email, create the project directory, initialize it as a Git repository, initialize a Node project using npm, create folders src, logs, and config, create a file src/index.js that prints a startup message, create a .gitignore file to ignore node_modules, make three meaningful commits by modifying the file each time, and finally display a compact commit history. Perform all operations using Unix commands and Git workflow.
Question 2 – Branching, Parallel Development and Merge Conflict
You and your teammate are working on the same file src/index.js but on different branches. You create a branch feature-auth, modify a line, and commit. Meanwhile, on main, the same line is modified differently and committed. When merging feature-auth into main, a conflict occurs. Simulate this entire process including branch creation, commits, merge attempt, conflict resolution preserving both changes, staging resolved file, committing, and checking final history.
Question 3 – Log Monitoring Using Unix Philosophy
A Node HTTP server continuously logs request URLs into server.log. Without modifying the server code, you are required to monitor the file in real-time, filter only lines containing the word ERROR, redirect those lines into error_logs.txt, count how many times the error appears, and run the monitoring process in the background. Use only Unix commands such as pipes, redirection, grep, and background jobs.
Question 4 – Blocking vs Non-Blocking Behavior Analysis
You are given two scripts: one using fs.readFileSync() and another using fs.readFile() to read a large file. You must demonstrate the execution difference by printing logs before and after file reading, explain why one blocks the server and the other does not, and describe what happens in the call stack and event loop.
Question 5 – CLI Modular Calculator Using CommonJS
Design a CLI-based calculator where mathematical functions are placed inside math.js and exported using CommonJS syntax. The main file should import the module using require, accept operation and numbers using process.argv, validate input, perform calculations, handle invalid operations gracefully, and demonstrate module caching behavior.
Question 6 – Git Automation Using Bash Script
Write a Bash script that checks whether the current directory is a Git repository, identifies the current branch name, checks if there are uncommitted changes, prompts the user for a commit message if changes exist, commits them, and displays the last five commits. If no Git repository exists, display an appropriate error message.
Question 7 – System Information Reporter Using Core Modules
Create a Node.js script that uses built-in modules (os, path, process, fs) to print platform name, CPU core count, memory information, current working directory, and absolute file path, save this information into system_report.txt, commit the file into Git, and explain the difference between absolute and relative paths used.
Question 8 – Secure Configuration Management
After accidentally pushing a secret API key to GitHub, redesign the project to store sensitive data using environment variables. Create a .env file, load variables inside Node.js, prevent the file from being tracked by Git using .gitignore, and remove previously committed sensitive data from Git tracking properly.
Question 9 – Complete Remote Collaboration Workflow
Initialize a local repository, push it to GitHub, clone it into another folder to simulate another developer’s system, create a feature branch there, commit changes, push them, return to original repository, pull updates, resolve conflicts if present, and explain the difference between git clone, git fetch, and git pull.
